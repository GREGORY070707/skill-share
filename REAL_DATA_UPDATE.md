# ‚úÖ Real Data Implementation - All Demo Content Removed

## Changes Made

### 1. ‚úÖ Homepage Statistics (index.php)
**Before:** Hardcoded demo numbers (5000+ students, 500+ workshops, etc.)

**After:** Real-time database queries
```php
$total_students = COUNT from users WHERE role = 'student'
$total_workshops = COUNT from workshops WHERE status = 'approved'
$total_enrollments = COUNT from enrollments WHERE status = 'completed'
$total_ngos = COUNT from users WHERE role = 'ngo'
```

**Result:** Homepage now shows actual platform statistics

---

### 2. ‚úÖ Teacher Dashboard (teacher-dashboard.php)
**Before:** Fake "4.8 Average Rating" stat

**After:** Real "Completed Workshops" count
```php
$completed = $total_workshops - $upcoming_count
```

**Result:** Shows actual completed workshops instead of fake rating

---

### 3. ‚úÖ NGO Dashboard (ngo-dashboard.php)
**Before:** Fake "95% Impact Score"

**After:** Real "Average per Workshop" calculation
```php
$avg_per_workshop = $total_beneficiaries / $partnered_count
```

**Result:** Shows actual average beneficiaries per workshop

---

### 4. ‚úÖ Database Schema (schema.sql)
**Before:** 4 sample workshops inserted automatically

**After:** Clean database with only admin user
- Removed all demo workshops
- Only creates admin account
- Teachers create real workshops

**Result:** Fresh start with no fake data

---

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT e.student_id) FROM enrollments e JOIN workshops w ON e.workshop_id = w.id WHERE w.teacher_id = ?
```

### NGO Dashboard:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM workshops WHERE ngo_id = ?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT e.student_id) FROM enrollments e JOIN workshops w ON e.workshop_id = w.id WHERE w.ngo_id = ?
