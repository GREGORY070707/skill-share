# ðŸ”§ Fixes Applied - SkillShare Platform

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… Database Connection Error
**Problem:** Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost'

**Solution:**
- Updated `config/database.php` - Changed password from `'Md7903435363@'` to `''` (empty)
- Updated `setup-database.php` - Changed password to empty string
- **Reason:** Default XAMPP MySQL root user has no password

**Files Modified:**
- `config/database.php`
- `setup-database.php`

---

### 2. âœ… Teacher Upload Content Feature
**Problem:** Teachers couldn't upload learning resources for students

**Solution:**
- Created `upload-resource.php` - Complete resource upload system
- Teachers can now:
  - Select their workshop
  - Upload resource title and description
  - Add resource URL/link (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.)
  - Choose resource type (PDF, PPT, Video, Link)

**Features:**
- Form validation
- Workshop verification (only teacher's own workshops)
- Success/error messages
- Beautiful modern UI

**Files Created:**
- `upload-resource.php`

**Files Modified:**
- `teacher-dashboard.php` - Fixed link to `upload-resource.php`

### 3. âœ… Student Resource Visibility (Privacy Fix)
**Problem:** All students could see all resources (no privacy)

**Solution:**
- Modified student dashboard to show **ONLY** resources from enrolled workshops
- Added SQL query with JOIN on enrollments table
- Each student sees only their own workshop resources

**SQL Query Logic:**
```sql
SELECT r.*, w.title as workshop_title
FROM resources r
JOIN workshops w ON r.workshop_id = w.id
JOIN enrollments e ON e.workshop_id = w.id
WHERE e.student_id = ? AND e.status = 'enrolled'
```

**Features:**
- Privacy-focused: Students only see resources from workshops they're enrolled in
- Workshop title displayed on each resource
- Resource type icons (PDF, Video, PPT)
- Direct download/access links
- Upload date displayed
- Empty state message when no resources available

**Files Modified:**
- `student-dashboard.php` - Added resources query and display section

---

## How It Works Now

### For Teachers:
1. Login as teacher
2. Go to Dashboard
3. Click "Upload Resources" card
4. Select workshop from dropdown (only your workshops)
5. Fill in resource details
6. Add resource URL (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.)
7. Click "Upload Resource"
8. âœ… Resource is now available to enrolled students only

### For Students:
1. Login as student
2. Enroll in a workshop
3. Go to Dashboard
4. Scroll to "My Learning Resources" section
5. âœ… See ONLY resources from YOUR enrolled workshops
6. Click "Access Resource" to view/download

## Database Schema Used

### `resources` Table
```sql
- id (Primary Key)
- workshop_id (Foreign Key to workshops)
- title (Resource title)
- description (Optional description)
- file_path (URL/link to resource)
- file_type (document, presentation, video, link, other)
- file_size (Optional)
- uploaded_by (Foreign Key to users - teacher)
- uploaded_at (Timestamp)
```

### Privacy Logic
- Resources are linked to workshops via `workshop_id`
- Students are linked to workshops via `enrollments` table
- Query joins these tables to show only relevant resources
- **Result:** Perfect privacy - students only see what they should see
