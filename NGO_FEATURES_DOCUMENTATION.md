# NGO Features Documentation

## Overview
Three fully functional features have been created for the NGO dashboard to enable effective partnership management, beneficiary tracking, and impact reporting.

### Functionality:

```

### UI Features:

WHERE e.workshop_id = ?

-- All beneficiaries aggregate
SELECT DISTINCT u.id, u.fullname, u.email,
       COUNT(e.id) as workshops_enrolled,
       AVG(e.attendance_percentage) as avg_attendance,
       SUM(e.certificate_issued) as certificates_earned
FROM enrollments e

GROUP BY u.id
```

FROM enrollments e JOIN workshops w ON e.workshop_id = w.id
WHERE w.ngo_id = ? AND e.enrollment_date >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 6 MONTH)
GROUP BY month

-- Top workshops
SELECT w.title, COUNT(e.id) as total_enrollments,
       AVG(e.attendance_percentage) as avg_attendance,

## Integration with NGO Dashboard

The NGO dashboard (`ngo-dashboard.php`) already has links to these three features in the "Quick Actions" section:

```php
<a href="partner-workshops.php">Partner Workshops</a>
<a href="beneficiaries.php">View Beneficiaries</a>
<a href="impact-report.php">Impact Reports</a>
```

## Database Schema Used

### Tables:
1. **workshops**: Stores workshop data with `ngo_id` for partnerships
2. **enrollments**: Tracks student enrollments with attendance and certificates
3. **users**: Student and teacher information

### Key Relationships:
```
workshops.ngo_id → users.id (NGO partnership)
workshops.teacher_id → users.id (Teacher relationship)
enrollments.workshop_id → workshops.id (Student enrollments)
enrollments.student_id → users.id (Student data)
```
